## Topic C: Stuff Sharing

> This is a stuff sharing application that allows people to borrow or loan stuff that they own (e.g., tools, appliances, furniture or books) either for free or for a fee (e.g. https://www.peerby.com). Users can advertise their available stuff for loan (what stuff, where to > pick up and return, when it is available, etc.) or can browse the available stuff and bid to borrow some stuff. The successful bidder for an advertised item could either be chosen by the item owner or automatically selected by the system based on some criteria. Each user has an account, and administrators can create/modify/delete entries.
